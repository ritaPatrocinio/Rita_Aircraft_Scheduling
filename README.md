Click on a flight to add it to the rotation!


To run this code in your computer:
Run `npm i` and then run `npm start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The schedule day is always “tomorrow” (as per the simplification).
The app shows a list of one aircraft (as per the simplification), which is obtained from the API (https://infinite-dawn-93085.herokuapp.com/aircrafts) 
and a list of all the flights the airline plans to operate that day, their origin, destination, departure time and arrival time, 
obtained from the API (https://infinite-dawn-93085.herokuapp.com/flights).

The app allows the user to view and edit the daily rotation for the selection aircraft.

The app lets the user edit the rotation freely but enforces the following rules:
Flights that have an arrival time after midnight can't be selected.
The time difference between the arrival time of one flight and the departure time of the next flight in the list of picked flights must be at least 20 min.
The origin of one flight must be the same as the destination of the previous flight in the list of picked flights.

To maintain coherence with the previously mentioned rules, a flight can only be removed from the top or the bottom of the picked flights list.

Because the second column fluctuates in size, I added the aircraft timeline in the first column to keep it above the fold.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
